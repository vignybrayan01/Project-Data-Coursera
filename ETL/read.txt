Introduction

Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) operations are of extreme importance in the role of a Data engineer. A data engineer extracts data from multiple sources and different file formats, transforms the extracted data to predefined settings and then loads the data to a database for further processing. In this lab, you will get hands-on practice of performing these operations.

Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

Read CSV, JSON, and XML file types.
Extract the required data from the different file types.
Transform data to the required format.
Save the transformed data in a ready-to-load format, which can be loaded into an RDBMS.
